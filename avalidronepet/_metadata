Also added some minor follow tweaks (doesn't follow you around as much). You can craft the Drone Dock from the Nanolathe.\n\n[h1]Purchasable Pets[/h1]\nPurchasable Pets version: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=946708622\n\nThis is honestly my first Starbound mod I've attempted, [b]If you encounter any problems let me know and I'll try my best to make things right.[/b]",
