In addition, the following parameters have been tweaked (so it doesn't seem like the drone follows you 24/7) and proper coding has been included for docking with the drone dock.\n\nHowever, the docking isn't perfect. The drone dock is still treated like a regular pethouse so the drone will become invisible as if \"entering\" the dock (as a pet would with a pethouse). I'm considering ways to fix this, but not sure when such a fix will see the light.\n\n[h1]Purchasable Pets[/h1]\nPurchasable Pets version: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=946708622\n\n[b]If you encounter any problems let me know and I'll try my best to make things right.[/b]",
